# Chapter 3 

Get some XML data that's paginated and has an access rate limit (google maps?).  
Show how we can loop to build up a series of URLs.  Create an iterative script 
and, for each iteration, extract some stuff from XML to add to a MongoDB
database.  Now do some queries on that database and generate an analysis
(perhaps an XY scatterplot).  EG: commute time x commute miles.  As homework,
students must accumulate a larger dataset and compare data in another way.

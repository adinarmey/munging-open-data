# Chapter 3 

Introduce 'length' and 'if/then' in Python.  Munge some JSON data with different types of cases; maybe complaints data with some resolved and some unresolved?  Or some with details and some with none?  Loop through the dataset and filter with if/then; think about how to turn hierarchical data into a tabular format, e.g. by doing counts and sums.

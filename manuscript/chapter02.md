# Chapter 2

Introduce Python lists and dicts.  Introduce looping.  Get some relatively clean JSON data (like NOAA tides data).  Show how to access elements by index or key to, for example, print a sentence saying "At time ______, sea level at station _______ is _____ feet".  Now use looping to munge it into a data frame, and output to CSV.

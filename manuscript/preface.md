# Preface 

This book aims to teach you a bit of Python data mungeing technique using real Open Data sources.  If I do it right, you will be so interested in what we're doing with the data that you learn the Python without realizing it.

## TODO

This will be a book of tutorials on mungeing open data with Python.

The objectives are to teach students about how data is structured in the wild, how it is communicated and can be accessed via APIs, and how to use Python tools for data mungeing and preparation.  There should be 15 tutorials for a 15 week course.  They will use "open data" sources because these are numerous, timely, and are likely to remain accessible at fairly stable APIs without necessitating API keys or passwords.

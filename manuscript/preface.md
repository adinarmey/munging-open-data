# Preface 

"There is a lot to data processing that is not data science" (Provost & Fawcett, 2013).  **Data mungeing** (also called data wrangling, data jiujitsu, data scrubbing, or data preparation) is the art of taking data from the wild and civilizing it so that it is integrated and well-structured for the sort of analysis you want to conduct.  Since big data is often about analytical re-use of data originally collected by someone else for some other purpose, data mungeing can take up the majority of a data scientist's time -- over 50%, in fact, according to a recent *NYT* article (Lohr, 2014).  It is ad hoc and improvisational work, though, rather than a science.

> "A good data munger excels at turning coffee into regular expressions and parsers, implemented in a high-level scripting language of choice... This is problem solving with programming, and quite different from statistics.  An aspiration toward excellence... is rarely rewarded, and often punished." (Driscoll, 2009)

If data mungeing is an art rather than a science, we cannot teach students to work with data by abstracting a set of general principles.  The hypothesis behind my writing this book is that, instead, the most effective approach might be to train our instincts by working through lots of different but similar problems via hands-on tutorials.  When complete, this book will include fifteen case studies---suitable for a 15-week university course---of increasingly "interesting" data mungeing problems.

The term **open data** denotes a movement toward greater public sharing of data, especially of data collected by government or government-funded institutions.  Recently there has been an explosion of great new data sources, often with well-structured and well-documented REST APIs, available from sites like Data.gov and Google Public Data.  This book's tutorials all use open data APIs that are likely to remain timely and stable for quite a while, and that are free of charge to access.  Learning how to retrieve data via HTTP web services in JSON and XML opens up a whole world of current, real-world data that you can use in business, research, and education.  And since we're not using canned data sets, you may even make unique new discoveries in real time as you do these exercises.

Gradually through 15 miniature data mungeing projects, readers will be exposed to Python and several of its most useful libraries for data science, including iPython and pandas.  If I do it right, you'll be so interested in what we're doing with the data, that you'll learn Python without even noticing it.  I don't want this to be a Python book that focuses on data preparation, but rather a data mungeing book that just happens to use Python.

# Chapter 1 

The world is full of data made available to the public by governments, universities, businesses and nonprofits.  You may find you want to use this data for research, analysis, to develop a data driven application or even to start a business.  Today, we're going to levearage this Open Data to practice some Python-based tools for data munging.

The U.S. government has organized thousands of datasets created by various agencies into a search engine and directory you can find at [](http://www.data.gov).

Take some time now to browse through the catalog of data available.  We'll explore several of these data sources before we're through with fifteen tutorials.  If you're not from the U.S., your home country probably has something similar.  Two examples are [Canada's open data portal](http://open.canada.ca/en/open-data) and [Britain's](https://www.data.gov.uk/).

This data comes in a variety of formats.  We'll start today with some well-structured CSV data from the Census Bureau's [American Community Survey](http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/american-community-survey), carried out every five years.

Download live Twitter Stream data and load into MongoDB.  Use the database
to JOIN it with some other data (a dictionary of sentiment words)
and create a result.  Another task could be a MR job that adds up these scored
Tweets to evaluate sentiment for brands, or politicians, or something.  As
homework, students might then do a MR job that aggregates sentiment by date and
brand, to produce a comparative line chart.
